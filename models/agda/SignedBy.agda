signed by val with noncing by identity ==
really needs to be part of a freshly generated challenge /uuid string mixed into the response to
ensure it can be MIM'd and rerouted to unrelated transactions

a related issue is making sure the signeatures at values and on the overall module/transaction unit are
'entangled' together so that manipulations wont validate

for manny applications it'd suffice to just do a signed by of a module/program as a whole
